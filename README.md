# Image processing & Audio processing ( Signal and Systems Course )

I. Image filtering and restoration
In this task, we will explore fundamental image processing operations, such as filtering in the 
spatial (space) domain using 2D convolution and basic image restoration in the frequency domain

II. Communication system simulation
In this task, we will simulate a communication system based on amplitude modulation and 
frequency-division multiplexing. We will explore recording and filtering audio, as well as 
displaying its spectrum.
